Setup Polkadot.js with Selendra To get started with the Polkadot.js library, we first need to install it using the following command: yarn add @polkadot/api Once done, the simplest setup to start using the library and its methods is the following: const { ApiPromise, WsProvider } = require('@polkadot/api'); const { Keyring } = require('@polkadot/keyring'); const dest = 'destination account'; const sender = 'sender Seed'; const amount = 'Sending amount'; const provider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc-testnet.selendra.org'); // Create the API and wait until ready const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider }); // Constuct the keying after the API (crypto has an async init) const keyring = new Keyring({ type: 'sr25519' }); const senderKey = keyring.addFromMnemonic(sender); // Get Chain Decimalse from node const decimals = api.registry.chainDecimals; // Create a extrinsic, transferring amount units to dest in xx amount const transfer = api.tx.balances.transfer(dest, (BigInt(amount * (10 ** decimals)))); // Sign and send the transaction using our account const hash = await transfer.signAndSend(senderKey); console.log(hash.toHex()); Different methods are available inside provider and wallet.

Being a nominator does not require running a node of your own or worrying about online uptime. However, a good nominator performs diligence on the validators that it elects. When looking for validators to nominate, a nominator should pay attention to its own reward percentage for nominating a specific validator - as well as the risk that it bares of being slashed if the validator gets slashed. Setting up Stash and Controller keys Nominators are recommended to set up two separate stash and controller accounts. You can generate your stash and controller account via any of the recommended methods that are detailed on the account generation page. Step 1: Bond your tokens On the UI of Selendra navigate to the \"Staking\" (underneath \"Network\") tab. The \"Account actions\" subsection allows you to stake and nominate. The \"Payouts\" subsection allows you to claim rewards from staking. The \"Targets\" subsection will help you estimate your earnings and this is where it's good to start picking favorites. The \"Waiting\" subsection lists all pending validators that are awaiting more nominations to enter the active validator set. The \"Validator Stats\" subsection allows you to query a validator's stash address and see historical charts on era points, elected stake, rewards, and slashes. Pick \"Account actions\" underneath \"Network\" > \"Staking\", then click the \"+ Nominator\" button. You will see a modal window that looks like the below: Select a \"value bonded\" that is less than the total amount of SEL you have, so you have some left over to pay transaction fees. Transaction fees are currently at least 0.0001 SEL, but they are dynamic based on a variety of factors including the load of recent blocks. Step 2: Nominate a validator You are now bonded. Being bonded means your tokens are locked and could be slashed if the validators you nominate misbehave. All bonded funds can now be distributed to up to 16 validators. Be careful about the validators you choose since you will be slashed if your validator commits an offence. Click on \"Nominate\" on an account you've bonded and you will be presented with another popup asking you to select some validators. Select them, confirm the transaction, and you're done - you are now nominating. Your nominations will become active in the next era. Step 3: Stop nominating At some point, you might decide to stop nominating one or more validators. You can always change who you're nominating, but you cannot withdraw your tokens unless you unbond them.

You will be accountable for not only your own stake, but also the stake of your current nominators. If you make a mistake and get slashed, your money and your reputation will be at risk. However, running a validator can also be very rewarding, knowing that you contribute to the security of a decentralized network while growing your stash. Initial Set-up Requirements Provisioning the server with following recommendation: OS: Linux x64 recommend Ubuntu 18.04 x64. RAM: 2GB or above. HDD/SSD: 60GB. Install Rust curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh rustup update install dependencies sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential Maxos brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm Install & Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) Client If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 / 19.04, NTP Client should be installed by default. timedatectl If NTP is installed and running, you should see System clock synchronized: yes Do not see it, you can install it by executing: sudo apt-get install ntp ntpd will be started automatically after install. You can query ntpd for status information to verify that everything is working: sudo ntpq -p Building and Installing the indracore Binary git clone https://github.com/selendra/indracore.git cd indracore ./scripts/init.sh cargo build --release You can begin syncing your node by running the following command: ./target/release/indracore --pruning=archive --chain sel if you do not want to start in validator mode right away. The --pruning=archive flag is implied by the --validator and --sentry flags, so it is only required explicitly if you start your node without one of these two options. If you do not set your pruning to archive node, even when not running in validator and sentry mode, you will need to re-sync your database when you switch. Bond SEL Make sure not to bond all your SEL balance since you will be unable to pay transaction fees from your bonded balance. It is now time to set up our validator. We will do the following: Bond the SEL of the Stash account. These SEL will be put at stake for the security of the network and can be slashed. Select the Controller. This is the account that will decide when to start or stop validating. First, go to the Staking section. Click on \"Account Actions\", and then the \"New stake\" button. Once everything is filled in properly, click Bond and sign the transaction with your Stash account. After a few seconds, you should see an \"ExtrinsicSuccess\" message. You should now see a new card with all your accounts (note: you may need to refresh the screen). The bonded amount on the right corresponds to the funds bonded by the Stash account. Set Session Keys Navigate to Toolbox tab and select RPC Calls then select the author > rotateKeys() option and remember to save the output that you get back for a later step. Validate If you go to the \"Staking\" tab, you will see a list of active validators currently running on the network. At the top of the page, it shows how many validator slots are available as well as how many nodes have signaled their intention to be a validator.
